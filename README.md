Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for machine learning and data analysis tasks. This project focuses on performing EDA to gain insights into the dataset.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic.

EDA Steps

The following EDA steps are performed:

1. Summary statistics:
    - Calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical features
    - Identifying missing values
2. Visualizations:
    - Histograms and boxplots for numerical features
    - Pairplot and correlation matrix for numerical features
    - Interactive histograms using Plotly
3. Pattern identification:
    - Identifying features with high skewness
    - Identifying highly correlated feature pairs

Code

The code is written in Python and uses popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Usage

To use this code, simply clone the repository and run the Python script. The code will perform the EDA steps and output visualizations and insights.
